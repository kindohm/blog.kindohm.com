I'll be performing a ~1 hour set as part of <em>Cyborg City</em>, a musical
aspect of the Sad Boys Popup Gallery happening this summer at Hamline University
in St. Paul.

I'm looking forward to sharing the stage with Tim Kaiser, a resident of my
hometown (Duluth, MN) and who makes all of his own noise-making equipment.
Chris LeBlanc will be there to put on his never-to-disappoint analog visual
show during all the music.

Expect a split of sounds from my
<a href="//naboamusic.com/catalog/kindohm-zerolikes">Zero Likes</a> EP as well
as from some new experiments involving the abuse of MIDI messages from code.

Where/When:<br/>
1493 Taylor Ave, St. Paul<br/>
