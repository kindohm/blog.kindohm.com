<em>Zero Likes. When we learn to keep up in a post-social, anti-social world.
When we are crippled by reduced status updates that have diminished to a mere
trickle. When we seek synthetic alternatives to the dried streams of content
that nourished our infomania. When future visitors to Our World unearth the
digital relics of our information age.</em>
