There's a hidden gem in the TidalCycles git repository called `tidal-vis`. It
allows you to use TidalCycles pattern syntax (and Haskell functions) to create
visual color patterns:

I have no idea what code I used to generate the image above, but I assure you
that it was really easy, given my existing knowledge of TidalCycles and Haskell.

BUT, installing `tidal-vis` takes a bit of effort. So here's how you do it.

<strong><span style="color: red;">DISCLAIMER:</span></strong> I have only gotten
this install to work on Linux Mint 18/Cinnamon. I imagine the install is similar
on a Mac. I tried it on Windows first, but my threshold for pain only goes so
far. Good luck, Windows users.

### 1. Install Dependencies
Open a terminal and runeach of these commands (assuming debian Linux):

```
sudo apt-get install git haskell-platform libghc-gtk-dev
cabal update
cabal install cabal-install
cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools
```

### 2. Install TidalCycles
You can skip this step if you already have TidalCycles installed.

```
cabal install tidal
```

### 3. Clone the TidalCycles repository.

There currently is some ambiguity around whether `tidal-vis` is correctly
published to Hackage to be installed from `cabal`. My approach is to
just get the source code and install `tidal-vis` from the source code later.

```
git clone https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal.git
```

NOTE: Remember where you cloned (e.g. ~/tidal).

### 4. Install tidal-vis

Did you remember where you cloned? I'll assume `~/tidal`:

```
cd ~/tidal/vis
cabal install
```

Bam. But you're not ready yet...

### 5. Install Atom and the TidalCycles package

If you're already using Atom and TidalCycles, then you've already done this.

- go to [http://atom.io](http://atom.io)
- download and install Atom
- In Atom, install the TidalCycles package
- restart Atom

The instructions are also given at
[tidalcycles.org/getting_started.html](http://tidalcycles.org/getting_started.html#installation)

### 6. Evil Laugh

If you got this far without any problems, congratulations. Cackle deeply.

## Let's Make Patterns

Open Atom. Create and save a file with a .tidal extension. If you ignore this
step, TidalCycles will not work.

Enter the following code in the file:

```
import Sound.Tidal.Vis
import qualified Graphics.Rendering.Cairo as C
import Data.Colour
import Data.Colour.Names
import Data.Colour.SRGB
let draw pat = vLines (C.withSVGSurface) "test.svg" (600,200) pat 3 1
```

Evaluate each of those lines one by one (Shift+Enter in Atom).

Then type or paste the following code into the file:

```
draw $ superimpose (iter 8) $ every 2 (slow 3) $
  every 3 (density 5) $ "[grey white black, lightgrey darkgrey]"
```

Eval the code. It will generate a file named "test.svg" somewhere on your
system. In my case, it was put in my home directory. It will look like this:

Hell yes.

## What's next?

Play! Modify the `draw` code above and see what else you come up with.

`tidal-vis` isn't documented very well _yet_. If you'd like to really dig in
to some of the color- and drawing-specific functions, you'll have to kind of
find that information on your own. My best recommendation is to look at
the `example.hs` file located in the TidalCycles repository:
[github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal/blob/master/vis/examples/example.hs](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal/blob/master/vis/examples/example.hs).
