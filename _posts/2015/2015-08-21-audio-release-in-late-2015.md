title: "Audio Release in Late 2015"
---

I'm hard at work producing a new music release for 2015. It's a follow
up to last year's <a href="http://xylemrecords.bandcamp.com/album/i-am-a-computer">I Am a Computer</a>
on Xylem records, and will be the second album I've produced with code,
live-coding, and algorithmic production techniques. I also plan on making the source
code available as an open-source project on Github, including the audio samples, 
under a Creative Commons license.

## Year-Long Journey
It's been an interesting year. I've been fortunate to perform alongside some 
fantastic artists this year, including <a href="http://johnkeston.com/">John Keston</a>,
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/mkr">MKR</a>, and <a href="http://blaerg.bandcamp.com/music">Blaerg</a>.
I've also put a lot of effort into getting better at sound design, audio synthesis, and
working with synthesizers and other non-laptop hardware. 

Perhaps the most memorable moment of 2015 (so far) was attending the first
<a href="http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/">International Conference on Live Coding</a>
in Leeds, UK this past July. I got to meet so many friends who I've only known
virtually over the past couple of years, and also saw some innovative and 
inspiring electronic music performances. I wrote up a full summary of that
trip <a href="/ICLC">here</a>.

## Producing with Code

Like my last release, this current release-in-progress is being made 
with <a href="//tidal.lurk.org">Tidal</a>, a live-coding and algorithmic music 
environment. I've found Tidal to be a much more intuitive way to make
the music that I like than with traditional DAWs, plugins, and hardware. 

One of the benefits of using code to produce music is that the code can
be shared. I'm planning on releasing the album's source code on Github,
along with the audio samples, under a Creative Commons license. Anyone
will be free to clone the repository and try out the code (assuming they've
been able to get Tidal up and running). In my programming career, I've always
enjoyed sharing my work to help others learn, and I think this is a great
way to do it with music. I'm eager to see if anyone else uses the material
for a remix.

## Original Sounds

One of the goals of this release is to use 100% original sounds. In the past,
I've produced music using sample packs or sounds I've attempted to cobble 
together, but I really wanted to use my own material for this release. I want
this release to be as authentic as possible. My idea for releasing the sounds
under a CC license also wouldn't be possible unless I created my own material
or found other samples under a CC license.

## Synths

Over the past year I've been working with hardware synthesizers for the first time.
Having no prior experience with hardware, it's been a big learning experience. 
I've had to learn the strengths and weaknesses of my synths and find the right
way to use them, and in a way feel like I've only found the tip of the iceberg
with the tools that I have.

An added challenge is that I don't use traditional tools and techniques to 
produce and perform with hardware. Sometimes it feels like I'm putting a
square peg in a round hole, but when things work out it's really fun.

## Release in Late 2015

I don't have a target date for a digital release, but I am hoping to have something
out by October 2015, maybe sooner if I'm lucky. 

I'm researching ways to get a release out on vinyl. I would love to work with
a local (Minneapolis) label, but haven't found the right fit yet. I'm open to 
suggestions!

I'll broadcast any news about the release on <a href="//facebook.com/kindohm">Facebook</a> and
<a href="//twitter.com/kindohm">Twitter</a>, and will certainly post here again
once it's out.
