title: "The ICLC2015 That Was"

<p>Last week, July 13-15 2015, was the first
<a href="http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/" target="_blank">International Conference
on Live Coding</a> in Leeds, UK. I had an amazing time and I returned refreshed
and inspired to continue pushing the limits of my code-based performances and
compositions. The conference was filled with an array of unique performances
and engaging presentations. Perhaps the biggest things I took from the conference
was all of the new friendships that I made and feeling welcome in the live
coding community.</p>

<p>First off, the performances at the conference were creative and inspiring.
There was everything from solo electronica, to laptop ensembles producing
minimal ambience, to poetry generation, to spoken-word audio processing, to
live coders controlling dancers and other instrumentalists through code
instructions.</p>

<p>Of course, things got noisy at night as well.</p>

<p>Many performances challenged traditional notions of what live coding is,
and also showcased new technologies doing very cool things. I was amazed to
see how far <a href="http://sonic-pi.net/" target="_blank">Sonic Pi</a> had
come during <a href="http://sam.aaron.name/" target="_blank">Sam Aaron&rsquo;s</a>
performances. In particular, how Sonic Pi can process incoming audio and its
ability to produce more irregular rhythms; I&rsquo;m eager to dive in to Sonic Pi
a bit since I last gave it a look many months ago. I also look forward to
pushing more limits of <a href="http://tidal.lurk.org" target="_blank">Tidal</a>,
after watching <a href="http://yaxu.org" target="_blank">Alex Mclean</a> sling
Tidal code in new ways I haven&rsquo;t thought of and also being inspired by
rhythmic performances in Supercollider
(<a href="http://calumgunn.com" target="_blank">Calum&rsquo;s</a> set in particular).</p>

<p>ICLC was the first academic conference I&rsquo;ve ever attended, and I
wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect. Most of my conference-attending experience
has been business-, industry-, trade-, or technology-related. While I was most
interested in learning about things that I could apply practically to my
musical practice, the philosophical presentations at ICLC were engaging.</p>

<p>Many presentations concerned themselves with definitions of live coding and
qualities of a live-coded artistic performance. One of the cornerstones of
these discussions was <em>improvisation</em>: live coders continuously make
changes to a running program to change its execution, and improvise either
deliberately or in response to unexpected results (mistakes and errors, in
  particular). I&rsquo;m interested in challenging this notion; are live
  coding and improvisation mutually exclusive? Can&rsquo;t I write code live
  to produce a repeatable performance that doesn&rsquo;t change from gig to
  gig?<sup>1</sup>  I&rsquo;m a newcomer to the world of live coding research
  and academia, so maybe I&rsquo;m naive and there&rsquo;s already research
  that argues against this idea, but I felt like this was a gap in the
  week&rsquo;s conversations. Perhaps it&rsquo;s an opportunity to do some of
  my own research for next year&rsquo;s ICLC 2016.</p>

<p>Related: Paul Wolinski just wrote a ICLC 2015 post that includes a
comparison of live coded art performance to public speaking. I think
it&rsquo;s a very good analogy: <a href="http://www.paulwolinski.co.uk/?p=357" target="_blank">http://www.paulwolinski.co.uk/?p=357</a>.</p>

<p>By far the biggest things I took away from the conference were new friendships
and feeling very much a part of the live-coding artistic community. It&rsquo;s
a strong community that is passionate about creating original art using code
in a live way.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a member of the live coding community from afar for almost
two years<sup>2</sup>, and have referenced, studied, and shared much of their
work, art, and recorded performances during that time. It was a world I&rsquo;d
only experienced virtually for so long; I knew the community and its members
well but had never met them in person. Then on the first day of the conference
I met everybody at once! I met so many new friends too. It was difficult to
leave the conference after sharing such a great three-day experience with them.</p>

<p>Thank you to all the event organizers - Alex, Shelly, Kia, Thor, Joanne,
and Ash - for making it such a successful and fun event! Looking forward to
ICLC 2016 in Hamilton, ON next year!</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> While I&rsquo;ve attempted to execute precise, repeatable
performances using live-coding techniques, they&rsquo;ve never gone according
to plan and I&rsquo;ve always improvised to some extent - whether that&rsquo;s
to fix minor errors, get back on track after a major disruption, or just
decide to change course.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> The heart of live-coded music is in the UK, with more strong
representation throughout the rest of Europe, Mexico City, Australia, and a
few other corners. There are few of us scattered across the U.S.</p>
