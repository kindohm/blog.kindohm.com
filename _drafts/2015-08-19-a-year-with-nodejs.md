After 15 glorious years of server-side web programming with .NET, last year I 
decided to become a part of a project that uses node.js for its 
server-side duties. I was eager to become a part of a node.js project in order
to learn something new; I was craving the feeling of being
"over my head" on a project and wanted to learn something very new.
